Introduction
============
This repo implements reinforcement learning adaptation algorithms based on ns3 simulation and opengym-ai environment. I am using ns3-gym and dash meets ns3 modudle from [1] and [2]. [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) is a toolkit for reinforcement learning (RL) widely used in research. The network simulator [nsâ€“3](https://www.nsnam.org/) is the de-facto standard for academic and industry studies in the areas of networking protocols and communication technologies. ns3-gym is a framework that integrates both OpenAI Gym and ns-3 in order to encourage usage of RL in networking research.

Added features
============
- Limit buffer size to maxBuffer,normaly the client will have a limited buffer size. But the original implementation in [1] allows clients to have unlimited buffer during playback which make client's behaviors unrealistic.
- Bandwidth fluctuation. Adaptive bitrate algorithms are design to cope with varying throughput therefore in the simulation, the throughput between client and server should be varied over time. 


Installation
============
1. Follow instruction in [1] to install ns3-gym
```
#run after installation
cd ns3-gym
```
2. Run rl-tcp test to make sure the installation success.
```
# Terminal 1:
./waf --run "rl-tcp --transport_prot=TcpRl"

# Terminal 2:
cd ./scratch/rl-tcp/
./test_tcp.py --start=0
```
3. Clone https://github.com/peterbangert/dash-meets-ns3gym [2] into contrib folder of ns3-gym
```
git clone https://github.com/peterbangert/dash-meets-ns3gym
```
4. Building:
```
#run under ns3-gym folder
./waf configure
./waf 
```

Examples
========
1. Running heureustic algorithms (festive, panda...):
```
./waf --run="tcp-stream-bitrate --simulationId='testbw' --maxBuffer=50000000 --numberOfClients=1 --adaptationAlgo=festive --segmentDuration=2000000 --bitRate=100 --bwfile=contrib/bwtrace1.txt --segmentSizeFile=contrib/dash-meets-ns3gym/segmentSizes.txt"
```
2. Running RL algorithms:
```
#1st terminal:
./waf --run="tcp-stream-bitrate --simulationId='testbw' --maxBuffer=50000000 --numberOfClients=1 --adaptationAlgo=rl-algorithm --segmentDuration=2000000 --bitRate=100 --bwfile=contrib/bwtrace1.txt --segmentSizeFile=contrib/dash-meets-ns3gym/segmentSizes.txt"
#2nd terminal:
cd ns3-gym/contrib/dash-meets-ns3gym/ns3gym/pensive
python3 pensive.py
```
#### Parameters 
- simulationId : string, simulation id (for logging purpose)
- maxBuffer : int, maximum capacity of clients' buffer
- numberOfClients: int, number of clients
- segmentDuration: uint_32, The duration of a segment in microseconds.
- bitRate: uint_32, default datarate value
- bwfile: string, path to bandwidth trace file for shaping bandwidth from server to accesspoint. Bandwidth will change to value specific in txt file every 1 second. The structure of the bwtrace1.txt should be: 
12321
34234
23233
- adaptationAlgo: string, adaptation algorithm name, pre-installed are festive, panda, tobasco, pensive(RL)[2]
- segmentSizeFile: The relative path (from the ns-3.x/ folder) of the file containing the sizes of the segments of the video. The segment sizes have to be provided as a (n, m) matrix, with n being the number of representation levels and m being the total number of segments. A two-segment long, three representations containing segment size file would look like the following:
	1564 22394  
	1627 46529  
	1987 121606
